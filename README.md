Getting to know GitHub
hello world, I'm Anthony and I love chicken. Chicken wings, rotissory chicken, fried chicken, grilled chicken, chicken from Qdoba... the list goes on. I'm hoping I don't get any chicken grease on my laptop as I work on the code for my senior design project. Otherwise, my view on chicken may slightly change. Chicken makes it hard for me to become vegitarian. What would life be; without chicken?
